# Astro-Experience
This is the VR Project I've made for my CS 4540 VR elective at California State University of Los Angeles. This is a very early build, and although it is in its infancy I am still proud to show it off. I may work on this some more and implement some of the things I had actually planned for the game, so stay posted. 

# Playing the game:
IF you want to try out Astro-Experience, you need an oculus quest 2. (This is the device I used to develop it) If you've got the quest, then there is an apk file under the builds folder that will allow you to try it for yourself. 
Please go ahead and do so! I always appreciate feedback.
